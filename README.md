🤖 ExpoAI: Discover Your Next AI Tool & Comprehensive Guide

Project Overview

ExpoAI is designed to be the definitive mobile platform for discovering, researching, and rating the latest Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools across various categories (e.g., Image Generation, Code Assistants, Productivity, Data Analysis, and more).
In the rapidly evolving AI landscape, users often struggle to find reliable information and user-driven feedback on new tools. ExpoAI solves this by providing a curated, intelligently categorized, and community-rated collection, ensuring users can make informed decisions about the AI solutions that best fit their needs.
This application is developed natively for Android using the Kotlin language, ensuring a fast, performant, and modern user experience.


✨ Key Features
ExpoAI will offer the following core functionalities:

1.	Intelligent Discovery & Filtering:
   
○	Category-Based Browsing: Quickly navigate tools by functional categories (e.g., Text-to-Image, Healthcare AI, Financial Analysis).
○	Advanced Filtering: Filter tools based on pricing model (Free, premium, Paid), integration capabilities (API, Web-Only), and use case (Personal, Business, Developer).

2.	Comprehensive Tool Profiles:

○	Detailed Guides: Each tool features a dedicated page with an in-depth, summarized guide on how to use it, best practices, and limitations.
○	Direct Access: One-tap access to the tool's official website or source.
○	Technology Breakdown: Listing of the underlying AI model (if public, e.g., GPT-4, Stable Diffusion, Llama) used by the tool.

3. Learning & Skill Development:

○	Step-by-Step Tutorials: Carefully crafted guides showing how to use each AI tool effectively
○	AI Tool Quizzes: Test your knowledge with interactive quizzes for each AI tool category.
○	Tool Limitations & Considerations: Understand the boundaries and ethical aspects of each AI tool

4.	Modern Mobile Experience:

○	Seamless navigation and a dark/light mode option.
○	Optimized search functionality for instant results.
